----------------------FLOW README----------------------
WARNING - THIS PLUGIN IS IN DEVELOPMENT STAGES. PLEASE KEEP BACKUPS OF ALL SERVER FILES!


WHAT IT IS - Flow is a liquid-control plugin. Flow is dedicated to combining all liquid control plugins into 1 plugin that has the ability to do what all of the other plugins do. The main goal of Flow is to keep streams from forming, then fix old streams with a command. As of v1.1.1, there is no code to prevent streams from forming, but it is a definite future update. I plan to be very dedicated to this plugin, and I hope Flow saves Ops the amount of time that I took to make it! 

HOW IT WORKS - This plugin has many functions. When using the command /flow, it sends you information about the plugin, and its commands. When using /flowfix, Flow looks for nearby streams below the block you are standing on, and turns them into source blocks. If a stream is created, Flow checks for nearby source blocks, and turns streams with surrounding sources into source blocks. Each of these features can be enabled/disabled in the config with the /flowset command, which toggles a feature while your server is running.

COMMANDS:

/flow <#> - flow.info - Shows # page of help.
/flowfix <#> - flow.fix - Fix water within # blocks.
/flowset <config value> - toggles a boolean in the config.
