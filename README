HOW?
This plugin was created by JamesNorris to help fix water streams. It works during rain to create a new water source block, next to an old water source block, as long as there is a solid block underneath it. This plugin can also be used without rain, but defaults to rain. (This is editable in the config)

WHY?
As far as I can tell, there are currently no plugins that fix streams COMPLETELY. This plugin aims to achieve that goal, and I will not stop working on this plugin until I can somewhat achieve that goal.

COMMANDS:

/flow - flow.info - SHOW FLOW INFO
/flowfix - flow.fix - FIX WATER WITHOUT RAIN
