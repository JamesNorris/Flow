HOW?
This plugin was created by JamesNorris to help fix water streams. It works to change stream blocks into water source blocks, in a given radius.

WHY?
As far as I can tell, there are currently no plugins that fix streams COMPLETELY (not trying to pick on anyone, in fact I thank him for this idea... (BergerKillers' "StreamRemover")). This plugin aims to achieve that goal, and I will not stop working on this plugin until I can somewhat achieve that goal.

COMMANDS:

/flow - flow.info - SHOW FLOW INFO
/flowfix <#> - flow.fix - FIX WATER MANUALLY (Radius is set by #)
