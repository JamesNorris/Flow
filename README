WARNING - THIS PLUGIN IS IN DEVELOPMENT STAGES. PLEASE KEEP BACKUPS OF ALL SERVER FILES!


HOW?
This plugin was created by JamesNorris to help fix water streams. It works during rain to create a new water source block, next to an old water source block, as long as there is a solid block underneath it. This plugin can also be used without rain, but defaults to rain. (This is editable in the config)

WHY?
As far as I can tell, there are currently no plugins that help prevent streams from forming COMPLETELY. This plugin aims to achieve that goal, and I will not stop working on this plugin until I can somewhat achieve that goal.

COMMANDS:

/flow info - flow.info - SHOW FLOW INFO
/flow fix - flow.fix - FIX WATER WITHOUT RAIN
